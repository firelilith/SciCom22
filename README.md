This module provides several ways to simulate gravitational interactions, as well as visualisation options. 

To start a simulation, you need to provide starting conditions in a CSV file. Every line represents an object, the first value is its mass, the second to fourth is its (barycentric) position in (arbitrary) cartesian coordinates, and the fifth to seventh its velocity.

An example:

```
1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0
10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
